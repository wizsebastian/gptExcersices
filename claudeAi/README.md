As a Python expert, I can help you learn English by developing a practical language learning application. This approach will not only improve your English skills but also enhance your Python programming abilities. Let's create a simple yet effective vocabulary trainer using modern Python practices.

This Python script creates a simple vocabulary trainer to help you learn English words and their translations. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

We use type hinting for better code readability and maintainability.
The VocabularyTrainer class encapsulates the core functionality, following object-oriented programming principles.
We use a list of dictionaries to store word pairs, making it easy to add or modify vocabulary.
The run_quiz method implements the main game loop, presenting words and checking answers.
We separate the main function from the class definition, following the principle of separation of concerns.

To use this trainer:

Run the script in your Python environment.
The program will present you with 5 English words.
Type in the translation for each word.
The program will tell you if you're correct and provide the right answer if you're wrong.
At the end, you'll see your score.

This approach helps you learn English vocabulary while also practicing Python programming. You can expand this program by:

Adding more words to the word_list.
Implementing a feature to load words from a file.
Creating different difficulty levels.
Adding a graphical user interface using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.

Would you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail or suggest ways to expand its functionality?
